Notes:
because of the consistant light level in the room it was not measured for every position but was measured before hand at between 5.3 and 6 ev 
first patchy pose on exp 24 (8,-1) m no problems exp 25
could not get pose exp 27 but after some adjustment decent pick up
some spotyness exp 29 (9,2)m
some spotyness exp 30 (9,-1)m
stopped after 31 because the room was only 9 m long very impressive
